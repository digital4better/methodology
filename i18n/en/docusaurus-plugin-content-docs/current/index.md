# Introduction

This documentation is written to share the methodological approach implemented by Digital4Better for assessing the environmental impacts of digital activities.
These methodologies are the result of research, literature reviews, and feedback from our teams.

This work is supported in particular by Bpifrance (BPI), with partial funding as part of our status as Wave 11 laureate of the I-Nov' competition.
