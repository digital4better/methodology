# Glossary

## Allocation
A rule for assigning impacts. For example, mass-based, economic, temporal, or data-volume-based allocation factors. This factor makes it possible to attribute its share to our item of interest.

## End-point approach
This “damage-oriented” method estimates the impact located at the end of the causal chain. It makes it possible to estimate potential damages by allocating several intermediate categories to one or more damage categories. These are then represented by damage indicators (see 1.2 - Indicators considered in the assessment).

## Mid-point approach
This “problem-oriented” method estimates the impact appearing in the middle of the causal chain. This view makes it possible to quantify the global effects of emitted or consumed substances. Inventory results with similar effects are grouped into impact categories called intermediate categories, to which a mid-point indicator is associated to compare the flows of substances contributing to the category in question.

## CDN (Content Delivery Network) {#cdn-content-delivery-network}
A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of computers connected through the Internet that cooperate to deliver content or data to users. (…) Optimization can translate into reduced bandwidth costs, improved user experience (lower latency), or both. (Source: Wikipedia).

## Environmental footprint
An indicator that assesses the pressure exerted by humans or an activity on resources and ecosystems.

## Equipment
Refers to any electronic device that makes up the three tiers (user equipment, network equipment, datacenter equipment). These devices are used to view, process, store, or transmit data and information. This can include computers, servers, printers, routers, storage peripherals, as well as communication devices like smartphones.

## Embodied impact
Impacts that occur during the creation and disposal of a hardware device (corresponding to the LCA phases: raw material extraction, manufacturing, transport, and end of life). These impacts rely on a fraction of total embodied impacts that must be allocated to the specific amount of use.

## Operational impact
Results from the use phase; this impact is based on the electricity consumption required for operation.

## Environmental indicator
The European Environment Agency defines an indicator as “an observed value representative of a phenomenon to be studied.” These indicators make it possible to assess the state of the environment. They are a subset of sustainable development indicators.

## PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) {#pue-power-usage-effectiveness}
PUE is an indicator used to measure the energy efficiency of a datacenter. It evaluates the datacenter’s performance by taking the ratio of total energy (sum of the consumption of IT equipment and the consumption of the data center infrastructure) to the energy used only by IT equipment.

## PCR (Product Category Rule)
A PCR describes the general principles for environmental labeling of consumer products in France. In our context, we focus on PCRs dedicated to digital services, which provide a framework for assessing the environmental impacts of digital services for environmental labeling. A common reference, known as the “parent” PCR: “Methodological reference for environmental assessment of digital services,” integrates a set of common rules for the derivation into more specialized “child” PCRs.

## Terminal
A terminal is an electronic device that allows a user to interact with a computer system. Terminals include various devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets, payment terminals, ATMs, etc. They generally serve to input, process, and display data, as well as run software applications. Terminals are the endpoint of communication and interaction with computer systems and networks.
